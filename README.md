The documentaions use a markdown editor (MkDocs) to create and generate documentation and save in GitHub Pages.

MkDocs is a fast, simple and good looking static site generator that's geared towards building project documentation. Documentation source files are written in Markdown, and configured with a single YAML configuration file.
