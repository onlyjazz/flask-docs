Concepts and terms The user should have API permissions - An API user that defined by FlaskData team. This API user has access to get data of his customer and EDC DBs that defined in his studies' EDC (dbname). There are 3 FlaskData API environments: development environment : dev-api.flaskdata.io staging environment : staging-api.flaskdata.io production environment : api.flaskdata.io All the API environments have swagger UI. Swagger Schemes should be HTTPS. For using FlaskData API by swagger you need to click on \"Try it out\" of the relevant API. Config/ change header and body request as needed and click on \"Execute\" button. ClinCapture EDC ClinCapture EDC is a database includes all study data (events, crfs, items, sites, subjects, data and etc.) Some studies use EDC data and UI to insert/update/delete/extract the study data. FlaskData and EDC are related, there are ETLs to load EDC data to FlaskData, FlaskData uses the data for analytics, alerts and etc. FlaskData APIs extract data from EDC. Flask Forms Flask Forms is a platform to save study CRFs data ( events, crfs, items and the data), This is a tool developed by FlaskData team, easy to use! Some studies use FlaskForms, The customer can build/ edit his study or FlaskData can do it for him. FlaskData and FlaskForms are related and there's a perfect user experience. FlaskData API extract data from FlaskForms data. Getting started Authorization For using FlaskData APIs you need to get token first. For getting FlaskData token use auth/authorize API. For example - in development swagger environment : https://dev-api.flaskdata.io/swagger/#/FLASK/post_auth_authorize In the body request (JSON) you need to set your API user's email and password, like: { \"email\": \"xxx@gmail.com\", \"password\": \"12345678\" } In the response body you get an access token, like: { \"token\": \"eyJhbGciOiJIUzM4NCIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJiV1BWaEJ3RnVMcGo2RjRTWVlkaENWSDBwZHR0SjlIZSIsImV4cCI6MTU3MjI3NjE5MDQwNywiaWF0IjoxNTcyMjY1MzkwfQ.f9CktAJxJ61D4act9ofB7wzfxOByREn22szMd6VqEW79E0L0AId_xXv4Vs4rdy8k\", \"expired\": \"2019-10-28T15:23:10.407Z\" } NOTE: The expired time is UTC time.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"#introduction","text":"","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"#audience","text":"Developers who want to use the Flask API to collect and extract data.","title":"Audience"},{"location":"#concepts-and-terms","text":"The user should have API permissions - An API user that defined by FlaskData team.

For more details and questions contact us by sending email to support@clearclinica.com . EDC Extract EDC Data There are a few APIs you can use to extract your ClinCapture EDC data. For example: /edc/study/extract-data This API extract EDC data of each table/view/function (like functionName()) and return json. fromDate, toDate, sort, filters and inputVariables(if tableName is a function) are optional values. Filters and inputVariable json objects - the key is the column name/ input variable name in postgres, the json value is the compare value (like where site = XXX)/ input value in function (like schema.function(XXX)).
