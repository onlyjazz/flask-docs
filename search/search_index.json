EDC - APIs are related to an external EDC instance (extract EDC data, etc.) Flask - APIs are related to the internal Flask data model (extract data, insert data, etc.) Request header Authorization parameter in the header request should be the token you had get before from you authorization request EDC parameter in the header request should be the EDC DB name . In this document there are a few examples of FlaskData APIs - There are more APIs, their description exists in swagger. For more details and questions contact us by sending email to support@clearclinica.com . EDC Extract EDC Data There are a few APIs you can use to extract EDC data. For example: /edc/study/extract-data This API extracts EDC data of each table/view/function (i.e. functionName()) and returns a json structure. fromDate, toDate, sort, filters and inputVariables are optional values if tableName is a function. Filters and inputVariable json objects: The key is the column name/input variable name in the EDC PostgreSQL database, the json value is the corresponding value (like where site = XXX)/ input value in function (i.e. schema.function(XXX)). Example { \"tableName\" : \"cc_event_data\" , \"fromDate\" : \"2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\" , \"toDate\" : \"2019-02-01T00:00:00.000Z\" , \"sort\" : \"subject\" } Another example: { \"tableName\" : \"cross_event_crf_data\" } /edc/study/download-csvs-data This API downloads a zip folder of CSV files with EDC study data. Each CSV file contains EDC Event-CRF data (Event is often called a Visit in an EDC) /edc/study/extract-study-data-at-crf-level This API extracts EDC data at CRF level and returns the data as a json object. This API returns only CRFs with data. This API has filters option (from date and to date are related to date_updated column, filters can include each column and value with equal sign). /edc/study/extract-study-data-at-crf-level-to-csvs This API extracts EDC data at CRF level and returns a zip folder includes CSV files (each CRF as CSV file). This API returns only CRFs with data. This API has filters option (from date and to date are related to date_updated column, filters can include each column and value with equal sign). /edc/subjects/create-subject This API creates a subject in EDC DB and returns the study_subject_id value. Flask /flask/customer/extract-data-to-json This API extracts data from flask tables and views for your customer. The table/ view should have customer_id column for this process. Examples studies table, audit_user_login, billing_reports_customer etc. studyIds and filters are optional. /flask/customer/download-billing-reports This API downloads a billing reports folder for the month of the billingDate parameter. The billing report zip folder includes all the billing report files for your customer. Note This process will download files only if the billing reports features turn on in your customer account. /flask/device/get-logs This API returns device logs of a study. /flask/device/insert-log This API inserts device log into flaskData with correct study_id according to EDC. payload parameter is optional and can include each key value pairs. /flask/study/create-update-flask-study This API creates/updates study in FlaskData. /flask/site/create-update-flask-site This API creates/updates site in FlaskData. /flask/study/create-update-flask-study-users This API creates User if not exists and assigned Users to study. Note This API deletes the Users that were assigned to this study and assigned the new Users. /data-server/data/extract/extract-study-event-data-to-CSV This API extracts all study data (from FlaskForms) based on study id and download CSV files. /data-server/data/extract/partial-extract-study-event-data-to-json This API extracts all study events and CRF data to JSON using a number of optional filters. You can extract all the data from a study with a simple request body like this: { \"study_id\": 7253541 } . This is like SQL SELECT * FROM clinicalData; Now let's look at our options: Choose what columns you want to select You can control the shape of the result object by using the columns field in your request body. This is like an SQL SELECT col1, col2, col3 FROM statement For example, if you need only crf , event and value fields use: \"columns\" : { \"_id\" : 0 , \"crf\" : 1 , \"event\" : 1 , \"value\" : 1 } Set the _id column to 0 (like in the above example). The API will selectively return the fields you set in the request body when you set them to 1. To get all the fields, don't set fields or specify the entire list of fields. This is like a SELECT * FROM statement. Filter records by date and/or column value You can refine record selection by the API with the date_from, date_to filters and setting values for fields. This is like the SQL WHERE clause - WHERE crf='Demographics' and eventDate between date_from AND date_to. Example \"filters\" : { \"date_from\" : \"2020-12-01T16:26:54.461Z\" , \"date_to\" : \"2020-12-31T16:26:54.461Z\" , \"crf\" : \"Demographics\" , \"item_type\" : \u201cINPUT\u201d } Note Reminder! If you don\u2019t set any filters field you will get all records. /flask/crf/create-CRF-and-insert-data This API creates a CRF in an existing event and inserts data into the CRF. Creates a new AE (adverse event) CRF in existing event. /flask/crf/create-event-CRF-and-insert-data This API creates event and CRF and inserts data. Example - Creates a new Medication event with CRF and inserts data. /flask/crf/get-CRF-data-ids This API returns subject's crf data Id (unique for each CRF) for specific crf name. /flask/crf/update-CRF-data This API updates CRF data by crf data id. Example of how to extract data using client-side JS code: Note The following code example should use the latest version of jQuery var xhrcall = $ . ajax ({ url : 'https://dev-api.flaskdata.io/flask/customer/extract-data-to-json' , type : 'POST' , headers : { 'Authorization' : jwt }, data : '{ \"tableName\": \"studies\", \"fromDate\": \"2018-03-29T11:44:12.511Z\", \"toDate\": \"2019-03-29T11:44:12.511Z\" }' , contentType : 'application/json' }); //promise syntax to render after xhr completes xhrcall . done ( function ( data ){ // Enter your code here }) . fail ( function ( error ) { if ( error ) { // Enter your code here } }); Save data to the Flask data model Use cases: You have a mobile app that collects data from a device or person, and you want to save the data to the Flask data model. You have a connected wearable device that connects to your phone app with BLE and you want to save some data to Flask. Pre-requisites: In order to insert data you will have already created the Study, Site, Event and Form (CRF) entities in the Flask data model: When you have ePRO (electronic patient reported outcomes), then the user credentials you pass to the API will be for the patient. When a site coordinator screens a patient, the Add Subject page automatically sends a Welcome email to the patient. The patient then clicks and sets a password. (Alternatively you can enable the patient to authenticate with their Google account) When you design a Form (CRF), the items in the Form map 1:1 to the data items that you want to save from your app. Application flow Let's say you have a daily Quality of life Form with a field for hours of sleep that you want to collect on your mobile app. You implement the form on your app with the input field and when the user saves the form on the app, you then save the data in Flask. Alternatively, if your mobile app does sleep tracking, you can take hours of sleep you tracked and save it to Flask every day at 10:00. Your app then sends the data to the Flask API as key-value pairs. See below. TIPS Flask Forms automatically names the item variables; you will probably want to reset variable names to something friendly like PATIENT_AGE or PATIENT_GENDER_CODE. If you are using radio buttons, check, select boxes in your mobile app - make sure that the values you pass are not offset by 1 by mistake - for example if PATIENT_GENDER_CODE is (1 - female, 2 - male) then make sure you pass 1 or 2 (and not 0 or 1). When you pass a numeric field - pass it like: \"AGE\": 25 not \"AGE\": \"25\". In JSON, strings are not integers. Radio buttons receive True or False values - pass it like: \"SUBJECT_IS_A_REDHEAD\": true. Dates have the usual timestamp format - pass it like: \"DATE_OF_ADMISSION\": \"2020-12-21 10:10:00.000Z\" Create an Event, CRF and insert data items You can save data to 1 or more CRFS in a single API call Create Event, CRF and insert data /data/create/create-event-crf-and-insert-data creates a new event with CRFs and insert CRFs data for one subject Important: If subject role token is used to call the APIs, then the request body doesn't need to include the subjectLabel or subjectId parameters. If CRC role token is used, then the request body must include subjectLabel or subjectId. In the below example, the API sends values of selected checkbox/select box items in the CRF. For example: Outcome: 1: 'Ongoing' { \"study_id\" : 6670398 , \"eventName\" : \"Common\" , \"CRFs\" : { \"Adverse Events\" : { \"Description\" : \"Patient developed a temperature\" , \"Anticipated\" : \"0\" , \"Serious\" : \"0\" , \"StartDate\" : \"01-Mar-2021\" , \"StopDate\" : \"03-Mar-2021\" , \"Outcome\" : \"1\" , \"Severity\" : \"1\" , \"RelatedTo\" : \"3\" , \"ActionTaken\" : \"1\" }, \"ConMeds\" : { \"GenericName\" : \"Aspirin\" , \"Dose\" : \"500\" , \"Units\" : \"mg\" , \"Route\" : \"1\" , \"RelatedToAE\" : \"1\" } } } Under the hood - Code generator - ePRO (Electronic patient reported outcomes) All this probably seems a little abstract, so lets see some working code. Surf over to the Flask API Example code generator The Code generator page is a React application that generates working NodeJS code; showing you the API call with proper arguments. You can copy and past the code and run it on the command line with nodejs. When you hit the green Run Function button - you will see the results from the API call on the page. As we mentioned before, the patient (AKA Subject) will have already been screened to the study and have credentials; we'll be using the Subject credentials in this API flow. The following sequence will show how to authorize the subject, get his user id and study subject label and insert some data. Authorization - pass the credentials of the subject (email and password). You'll authorize the Subject after she logs in to your app with the credentials she set on her Welcome to Flask email. Get User profile - pass the JWT token and get the Subject ID and Subject label (and a bunch of other fields) Get studies of subject - pass the JWT token with the Subject ID and get the Study ID of the study where the Subject is enrolled Create CRF and insert data - pass the JWT token with Study ID, Subject ID and the CRF payload and voila - you've inserted data! ```","title":"Flows"},{"location":"apiflows.html#api-flows","text":"The API has 2 parts of APIs - EDC and Flask.

You have a connected wearable device that connects to your phone app with BLE and you want to save some data to Flask. Pre-requisites: In order to insert data you will have already created the Study, Site, Event and Form (CRF) entities in the Flask data model: When you have ePRO (electronic patient reported outcomes), then the user credentials you pass to the API will be for the patient. When a site coordinator screens a patient, the Add Subject page automatically sends a Welcome email to the patient. The patient then clicks and sets a password. (Alternatively you can enable the patient to authenticate with their Google account) When you design a Form (CRF), the items in the Form map 1:1 to the data items that you want to save from your app. Application flow Let's say you have a daily Quality of life Form with a field for hours of sleep that you want to collect on your mobile app. You implement the form on your app with the input field and when the user saves the form on the app, you then save the data in Flask. Alternatively, if your mobile app does sleep tracking, you can take hours of sleep you tracked and save it to Flask every day at 10:00. Your app then sends the data to the Flask API as key-value pairs. See below. TIPS Flask Forms automatically names the item variables; you will probably want to reset variable names to something friendly like PATIENT_AGE or PATIENT_GENDER_CODE. If you are using radio buttons, check, select boxes in your mobile app - make sure that the values you pass are not offset by 1 by mistake - for example if PATIENT_GENDER_CODE is (1 - female, 2 - male) then make sure you pass 1 or 2 (and not 0 or 1). When you pass a numeric field - pass it like: \"AGE\": 25 not \"AGE\": \"25\". In JSON, strings are not integers. Radio buttons receive True or False values - pass it like: \"SUBJECT_IS_A_REDHEAD\": true. Dates have the usual timestamp format - pass it like: \"DATE_OF_ADMISSION\": \"2020-12-21 10:10:00.000Z\"","title":"Use cases:"},{"location":"apiflows.html#create-an-event-crf-and-insert-data-items","text":"You can save data to 1 or more CRFS in a single API call Create Event, CRF and insert data /data/create/create-event-crf-and-insert-data creates a new event with CRFs and insert CRFs data for one subject Important: If subject role token is used to call the APIs, then the request body doesn't need to include the subjectLabel or subjectId parameters.

As we mentioned before, the patient (AKA Subject) will have already been screened to the study and have credentials; we'll be using the Subject credentials in this API flow. The following sequence will show how to authorize the subject, get his user id and study subject label and insert some data. Authorization - pass the credentials of the subject (email and password). You'll authorize the Subject after she logs in to your app with the credentials she set on her Welcome to Flask email. Get User profile - pass the JWT token and get the Subject ID and Subject label (and a bunch of other fields) Get studies of subject - pass the JWT token with the Subject ID and get the Study ID of the study where the Subject is enrolled Create CRF and insert data - pass the JWT token with Study ID, Subject ID and the CRF payload and voila - you've inserted data! ```","title":"Under the hood - Code generator - ePRO (Electronic patient reported outcomes)"},{"location":"edc.html","text":"EDC FlaskData team support ClinCapture system.

Includes a library of ready-to-go eCRF templates. Runs on desktops, notebooks, tablets and phones. Build your eSource app In Forms page you can define the study's CRFs, Events , Pro and Alert rules. CRFS In order to create a new CRF click on ADD CRF green button CRF Properties In CRF card you need to define the CRF properties (You can also edit it after the saving). * Queries status - Turn on/off CRF queries option (See manage queries ). When CRF queries is Turn on - each item in this CRF has queries dialog - add query by click on the question mark. Layout - Layout of CRF, There are several layouts: Default (question after question vertically) Grid Cards on grid Columns - If the layout is grid or Cards on grid choose the number of fields in each row. Name - CRF name Description - CRF Description Click YES to create this CRF Layout examples: Default layout Grid layout Cards on grid layout CRF Sections In Section card define CRF's section, You can also edit it after the saving. (One CRF can include more than one section) Name Description You can add sections to CRF by click on ADD SECTION button CRF Items You can define items in each CRF. By click on component the component is added to the CRF (in the end of the list) After adding item you should define the new item properties by click on EDIT option Edit CRF Item By click on EDIT button of item an Edit card is opened. Labels In the first tab LABELS you should define item's name, description etc. Value The second tab is VALUE you can set a default value to this item Variable Assignment The third tab VARIABLE ASSIGNMENT , is used to place data in an item. The data source can be another item in the CRF or from an external API. To extract data from an external API, use the get() function. The Key entry functions as a data source configuration key to an external API, allowing secured access to certain data. The customer can define a default external API in Customer Metadata , allowing the user to write get() without specifying a URL. To select specific data field, use commands similar to 'get()[rates]'. For input values, the data type should be a single value. For get() the data type should be be a JSON object. For example: {\"aaa\":1; \"bbb\":2} will output a list of aaa, bbb(values:1,2) To use the autocomplete feature, type '$' and select the variable of interest. Use variables to create expressions for calculating the value of an item based on other existing values. Use the get() function to extract the value of the item from an external source. Note The terminal supports any JavaScript expressions for the value of the available form variables. Validations The fourth tab is Validation , each component has another validation options. For example - number component has the following validation tab: Required, Disabled and Confirm parameters exist in each component. Required - Check it if this item is a mandatory. Disabled - Check it if this item is disabled - the user cannot change/edit it Confirm - This item popup a confirm dialog card. Branching Logic The fifth tab is the Branching Logic , In this tab you can write a simple logic for this item. Quote Branching logic expression for this item To use the autocomplete service, type \"$\" and select the variable of interest for you. Use variables to make expression for hide current form control. The terminal supports any JavaScript expressions for the value of the available form variables. For example: $ITEM_IMPORTANT_VAR == 'string_var_value' For example - Show/Hide method.

Metrics can be computed using a pattern language referencing data variables in your study. The Metrics pattern language The pattern language was designed to enable you to create metrics of performance, exceptions, missing data, or critical values on the patient timeline. The language uses item variable names - like $CHANGE_IN_SEVERITY. Simple single variable expressions You can use a simple expressions like $CHANGE_IN_SEVERITY == '0' , Count things You can count things using COUNT and FILTER count($CHANGE_IN_SEVERITY ) == '0' or filter($PATIENT_REPORTED_RESTLESSNESS) == '0' . Compound expressions You can combine expressions using logical operators like && (AND) or || (OR). Examples $ELIGIBILITY == '1' && count($TREATMENT_SESSIONS) > '0' $CHANGE_IN_SEVERITY > 2 || $PATIENT_REPORTED_RESTLESSNESS == '0' count($CONMED) <= '5' Functions Counting things count(variable, period) - the count function counts a variable entered in a time period. The count function will return the number of records in the dataset where the variable has any value. If the count is 0 then the data is missing. The count function takes 2 arguments: variable - the unique variable name of the CRF item. period - an optional time period counting data for each patient. Period is a time interval like 24 hours Info You can use the following time units: milliseconds seconds minutes hours days weeks months years Usage examples: count($ADVERSE_EVENTS) - Count adverse events for each patients. count($ADVERSE_EVENTS, '24 hours') - Count adverse events for patients in the last 24 hours. count($ADVERSE_EVENTS, '7 days') - Count for the last 7 days Say you want to find patients missing blood test data in the last 24 hours - you'd do this: count ( $BLOOD_TEST , '24 hours' ) == '0' ; The metric will have the value of 1 for all patients missing blood tests in the last 24 hours. Filter - more complex counting filter(variable, period, value, take) - the filter function enables you to filter on values looking forwards and backwards on the patient journey. Like count, filter returns the number of records entered into the database for the variable. Arguments: variable - the unique variable of the CRF item period - an optional time period for filtering patient data according to CRF create date. value - an optional filter using a comparison operator like >2 , yes , ==5 take - an optional argument to take the first N records or last N records in the dataset for each patient. Info You can use the following operators: * `==` * `!=` * `>=` * `<=` * `>` * `<` Example ==2 some string value >=5 the expression ==2 and 2 or ==yes and yes are equivalent! The value of the take parameter will be a string like '-1' , '1' , '5' The take parameter enables you to take events from the beginning or end of the patient timeline: Examples '1' - The first event '2' - The first 2 events '-1' - The last event '-4' - The last 4 events the records returned from the database are ordered by date created. Filter arguments are evaluated in this order: filtering by variable filtering by period filtering by 'take' filtering by 'value' if you don't need to use some parameter you can set null instead. Usage examples filter($SCREENED) - count the $SCREENED variable for each patient. filter($EPRO_DIARY, '24 hours') - count 1 if any diaries were entered by each patient in the last 24 hours filter($TOOK_ANALGESICS, '24 hours', '>2') - count 1 for each patient who took pain analgesics more than twice in the past 24 hours filter($TOOK_ANALGESICS, null, '>2') - count 1 for each patient who took pain analgesics more than twice in the study filter($TOOK_ANALGESICS, null, '>2', '-2') - count 1 for each patient who took pain analgesics more than twice in the last 2 study events You can do a comparison operation on the filter count and return a 0/false or 1/true for the metric: filter ( $TOOK_ANALGESICS , '24 hours' , '>2' ) > '0' ; Or just do the filter count and return a number for the metric like this: filter ( $ELSE_ONE_VARIABLE , '24 hours' , '>2' ) Under the hood of the pattern language for the curious You can use a simple expressions like $AGE == '77' . In this case this expression will be replaced to filter($AGE, null, '== 77') != 0 Example Input Output $SOME_VARIABLE == '0' filter($SOME_VARIABLE, null, '== 0') != 0 $SOME_VARIABLE filter($SOME_VARIABLE, null, null) != 0 $SOME_VARIABLE == '3'&& $ELSE_ONE_VARIABLE > '2' filter($SOME_VARIABLE, null, '== 3') != 0 && filter($ELSE_ONE_VARIABLE, null, '>2') != 0 Examples of expression to the various components Component Expression INPUT $ITEM_AT2_COMPONENT_INPUT == 'test' NUMBER $ITEM_AT2_COMPONENT_NUMBER == '5' BIPOLAR NUMBER $ITEM_AT2_COMPONENT_BIPOLAR_NUMBER['0'] == '3' TEXTAREA $ITEM_AT2_COMPONENT_TEXTAREA == 'test' CHECKBOX $ITEM_AT2_COMPONENT_CHECKBOX == 'true' RADIO $ITEM_AT2_COMPONENT_RADIO == '0' BIPOLAR RADIO $ITEM_AT2_COMPONENT_RADIO == '0' MULTIPLE SELECT $ITEM_AT2_COMPONENT_MULTIPLE_SELECT == '0' SINGLE SELECT $ITEM_AT2_COMPONENT_SINGLE_SELECT == '1' PASSWORD $ITEM_AT2_COMPONENT_PASSWORD == '12345678' CHECKBO GROUP $ITEM_AT2_COMPONENT_CHECKBOX_GROUP['0'] == 'true' EMAIL $ITEM_AT2_COMPONENT_EMAIL == 'some.mail@gmail.com' PHONE NUMBER $ITEM_AT2_COMPONENT_PHONE_NUMBER == '380973768485' DATE $ITEM_AT2_COMPONENT_DATE == '2021-03-19T00:00:00.000Z' DATE TIME $ITEM_AT2_COMPONENT_DATE_TIME == '2021-03-19T13:15:00.000Z' BIPOLAR DATE $ITEM_AT2_COMPONENT_BIPOLAR_DATE['0'] == '2021-03-19T00:00:00.000Z' TIME $ITEM_AT2_COMPONENT_TIME =='2021-03-19T22:00:02.882Z' FILE $ITEM_AT2_COMPONENT_FILE == '1617024475170_rr.jpg' Add Metric In order to add a metric click on ADD METRIC green button.

Metrics can be computed using a pattern language referencing data variables in your study. The Metrics pattern language The pattern language was designed to enable you to create metrics of performance, exceptions, missing data, or critical values on the patient timeline. The language uses item variable names - like $CHANGE_IN_SEVERITY. Simple single variable expressions You can use a simple expressions like $CHANGE_IN_SEVERITY == '0' , Count things You can count things using COUNT and FILTER count($CHANGE_IN_SEVERITY ) == '0' or filter($PATIENT_REPORTED_RESTLESSNESS) == '0' . Compound expressions You can combine expressions using logical operators like && (AND) or || (OR). The logical operator !(NOT) can also be used. Examples $ELIGIBILITY == '1' && count($TREATMENT_SESSIONS) > '0' $CHANGE_IN_SEVERITY > 2 || $PATIENT_REPORTED_RESTLESSNESS == '0' count($CONMED) <= '5' Functions Counting things count(variable, period) - the count function counts a variable entered in a time period. The count function will return the number of records in the dataset where the variable has any value. If the count is 0 then the data is missing. The count function takes 2 arguments: variable - the unique variable name of the CRF item. period - an optional time period counting data for each patient. Period is a time interval like 24 hours !!info You can use the following time units: * milliseconds * seconds * minutes * hours * days * weeks * months * years Usage examples: count($ADVERSE_EVENTS) - Count adverse events for each patients. count($ADVERSE_EVENTS, '24 hours') - Count adverse events for patients in the last 24 hours. count($ADVERSE_EVENTS, '7 days') - Count for the last 7 days Say you want to find patients missing blood test data in the last 24 hours - you'd do this: count ( $BLOOD_TEST , '24 hours' ) == '0' ; The metric will have the value of 1 for all patients missing blood tests in the last 24 hours. Filter - more complex counting filter(variable, period, value, take) - the filter function enables you to filter on values looking forwards and backwards on the patient journey. Like count, filter returns the number of records entered into the database for the variable. Arguments: variable - the unique variable of the CRF item period - an optional time period for filtering patient data according to CRF create date. value - an optional filter using a comparison operator like >2 , yes , ==5 take - an optional argument to take the first N records or last N records in the dataset for each patient. Info You can use the following operators: == != >= <= > < Example ==2 some string value >=5 the expression ==2 and 2 or ==yes and yes are equivalent! The value of the take parameter will be a string like '-1' , '1' , '5' The take parameter enables you to take events from the beginning or end of the patient timeline: Examples '1' - The first event '2' - The first 2 events '-1' - The last event '-4' - The last 4 events the records returned from the database are ordered by date created. Filter arguments are evaluated in this order: filtering by variable filtering by period filtering by 'take' filtering by 'value' if you don't need to use some parameter you can set null instead. Usage examples filter($SCREENED) - count the $SCREENED variable for each patient. filter($EPRO_DIARY, '24 hours') - count 1 if any diaries were entered by each patient in the last 24 hours filter($TOOK_ANALGESICS, '24 hours', '>2') - count 1 for each patient who took pain analgesics more than twice in the past 24 hours filter($TOOK_ANALGESICS, null, '>2') - count 1 for each patient who took pain analgesics more than twice in the study filter($TOOK_ANALGESICS, null, '>2', '-2') - count 1 for each patient who took pain analgesics more than twice in the last 2 study events You can do a comparison operation on the filter count and return a 0/false or 1/true for the metric: filter ( $TOOK_ANALGESICS , '24 hours' , '>2' ) > '0' ; Or just do the filter count and return a number for the metric like this: filter ( $ELSE_ONE_VARIABLE , '24 hours' , '>2' ) Under the hood of the pattern language for the curious You can use a simple expressions like $AGE == '77' . In this case this expression will be replaced to filter($AGE, null, '== 77') != 0 Example Input Output $SOME_VARIABLE == '0' filter($SOME_VARIABLE, null, '== 0') != 0 $SOME_VARIABLE filter($SOME_VARIABLE, null, null) != 0 $SOME_VARIABLE == '3'&& $ELSE_ONE_VARIABLE > '2' filter($SOME_VARIABLE, null, '== 3') != 0 && filter($ELSE_ONE_VARIABLE, null, '>2') != 0","title":"Metrics"},{"location":"metrics.html#metrics-definitions","text":"Flask enables you to create patient-level metrics to measure study performance and progress.
