**Collect, Detect and Act**

FlaskData is a cloud API platform to collect and monitor clinical data.

FlaskData helps you achieve high levels of protocol compliance and save time and money by automating the manual work of compliance monitoring in clinical trials.  

The FlaskData platform provides real-time data collection and automated detection and response. An open [API](https://api.flaskdata.io/swagger)  architecture fits easily into any digital health, digital therapeutics or eClinical software.  Flask collects data from any combination of sources – investigators, patients, mobile, wearables, passive monitoring, connected medical devices and code.

Collect provides you with desktop, mobile and RESTful Flask Data [API](https://api.flaskdata.io/swagger/) services to collect data directly from patients, investigators and connected medical devices.

Detect  provides you with the capability to automated deviation monitoring of all your clinical data continuously. This is based on techniques used widely in cyber security – read more here about

Act  provides you with the capability to automate response to patients and clinical operations teams with push notifications triggered by computed protocol compliance metrics over threshold.
